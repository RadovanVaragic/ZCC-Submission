This program is made in JS and utilises NodeJS.

Hi, my name is Radovan Varagic and I am a third year CSSE student. This is my mostly complete submission for the coding challenge
and though I was unable to comply with all the required requests I truly hope you can overlook this in favour of my
appeal to your specifications and the mostly complete implementation. The database responds with 200s and can transmit
buffer chunks which is always a good sign! Unfortunately I am unsure how to progress beyond here(Believe me I have tried),
regardless, this is something I'd be more than happy to learn in working with the crew in Dublin. The code is commented as
clearly and concisely as I believe it can be.

I have been successful in converting the buffers from the Zendesk API to a utf8 format but I am unsure how to extract ticket data
I had hoped I could complete it but regardless I hope this is enough for now and I have cleaned the code as well as I could. 
Thank you again for reading through this and looking through my code, if I do not get the job, even feedback would be appreciate!

Cheers :D
